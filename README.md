Thank you so much for taking your time to look at my project!

I created this project for a Shopify internship, it is a simple project using mainly Javascript, some CSS, and a bit of HTML.

To start it just open "index.html" file in your Google Chrome browser.

P.S. I am a dog person, but cats are fun to look at.
